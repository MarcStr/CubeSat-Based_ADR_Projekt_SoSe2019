 abstract = {This work addresses flight results and practical challenges of the Autonomous Vision Approach Navigation and Target Identification in-orbit demonstration. This endeavor realized a fully autonomous rendezvous to a noncooperative target in low Earth orbit, in the separation ranges between tens of kilometers to 50 m, relying exclusively on angles-only observations extracted from pictures collected by a monocular, far-range, camera system. By considering experiment commissioning and execution phases, a total of two months of in-orbit experience could be collected, making AVANTI the most authoritative benchmark for designing the first phase of the approach for future active debris removal missions. Accordingly, this work revisits how crucial design decisions revealed decisive to the success of the mission and how they impacted the obtained experiment performances. As conclusion, such lessons learned gained from the flight campaign are reshaped as design guidelines for handing over the peculiar guidance navigation and control system - referred as to AVANTI-concept - to future rendezvous missions.},

@article{Peng.2018,
 abstract = {This paper addresses the design methodology and verification of electrical power system (EPS) for Aoxiang-Sat, the world's first 12U CubeSat on orbit to detect the polarization of the light of the Earth's atmosphere. Considering the specific characteristics of Aoxiang-Sat, a novel-centralized EPS architecture using COTS devices for micro/nanosatellite is proposed. Based on the power budget analysis of Aoxiang-Sat, design process along with the operation modes of the EPS is discussed. To obtain the most power from photovoltaic conversion, maximum peak power tracking (MPPT) based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is carried out and studied using Matlab/Simulink. The functionality and reliability of the proposed EPS are verified through comprehensive ground tests. On-orbit telemetry data of the EPS confirm that it can effectively convert, store, condition, and distribute the power generated by solar panels, and the EPS worked with excellent performance during the 3-month lifetime of Aoxiang-Sat from June to September of 2016.},
